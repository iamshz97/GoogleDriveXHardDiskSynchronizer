# ðŸŒ¥ Google Drive X Hard Disk Synchronizer (SLT daily broadband users) ðŸ’¾

Welcome to the Google Drive X Hard Disk Synchronizer, a custom tool specifically made for SLT daily broadband users. It's a handy tool that ensures your favorite files on Google Drive are available on your local hard disk, and it smartly uses your remaining daily data balance. Say goodbye to manual downloads and enjoy automated synchronization during off-peak hours.

## âš™ How it Works

Once launched, this tool will scan the files in your configured Google Drive and local hard disk directories. It compares the file list and starts downloading the missing files from the Drive to the hard disk. The downloading is smart! It respects your daily data usage and ensures a safe margin is always left.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

All the magic numbers are in the `appsettings.json` file:

- `Folders:GoogleDriveFolder` & `Folders:HardDiskFolder`: Paths to your Google Drive and hard disk directories.
- `LoginDetails:Username`, `LoginDetails:Password` & `LoginDetails:SubscriberID`: Your SLT login details.
- `DataReserve`: Amount of data (in GB) to keep untouched.

Update these according to your preferences and you're good to go.
